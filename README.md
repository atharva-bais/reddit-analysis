# reddit-analysis
A GUI python application which summarises a subreddit and returns meaningful graphs and stats.
Was done for a 1 credit project, data visualisation at VIT university vellore.

If you want to contribute, here's what you can do
1. Make it faster, it takes a long time to return information, use datastructures as you please
2. Fix the emoji issue. Python uses utf8 encoding, some characters on reddit are utf16. This issue causes program to crash at times.
3. Make it more user friendly, attractive, you can bind the enter key with search button. Or add decorations as you please.
